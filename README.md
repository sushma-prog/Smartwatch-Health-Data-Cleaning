# 🩺 Smartwatch Health Data Cleaning - Kaggle Practice

This project focuses on cleaning real-world smartwatch health data to make it ready for further analysis or machine learning modeling. It's part of my hands-on practice using Python and Pandas on Kaggle.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains health-related information collected from a smartwatch. It includes features like:
- Heart Rate
- Sleep Duration
- Body Temperature
- Blood Oxygen Level
- Steps
- and more...

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning Tasks Performed
- ✅ **Handling Missing Values**  
  Used mean/mode/median for numerical and categorical columns.
  
- ✅ **Data Transformation**  
  Converted columns into appropriate data types.

- ✅ **Encoding Categorical Variables**  
  Used label encoding for binary categories.

- ✅ **Outlier Detection & Handling**  
  Visualized outliers using box plots and handled where necessary.

- ✅ **Exporting Cleaned Data**  
  Final cleaned dataset saved as `cleaned_smartwatch_health_data.csv`.

## 🔍 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
